This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository and install dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/Ar0manKhan/sudoku.git
cd sudoku
```
Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Running the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Building for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

Note: It uses service worker and caches the assets for offline use. To test the offline functionality, run the production build and then run the server using `npm run start` or `yarn start` or `pnpm start`. If you update any thing in the code, you'll need to hard reload the page and clear the cache to see the changes.


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
